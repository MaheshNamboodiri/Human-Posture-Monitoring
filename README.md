# Human-Posture-Monitoring


The aim is to create a prototype for monitoring human posture, using a flex sensor which is attached on the back of the person. 
The posture of the user is constantly checked, and reminders are sent as soon as the user bends his or her back beyond a degree which can potentially cause pain in the long-run. Furthermore, I have integrated a cloud, so that performance of the device can be monitored in real time.
The system uses an ESP8266, an LCD, a buzzer, and a voltage divider circuit made of a flex sensor and a 10K ohm resistor.

When the back of the user bends, the flex sensor gains more voltage, and beyond a certain value, it causes an alarm to ring, as a reminder to the user to correct his or her posture.
